Chef Alec began crafting various charcuterie in his deli, which gained nationwide and Canadian fame. In 2005, Alef Sausage expanded from its small USDA plant to a 16,000 sq ft facility. The family operation produced 200 pounds of charcuterie daily and became a huge success. Alef Sausage presently expanded to 80,000 sq ft  and produces 25,000 pounds of product daily. Our company became WBENC certified in 2021. We use all-natural ingredients, handmade by certified master meat crafters. Alef Sausage combines old-world recipes with modern technology to preserve the flavors of Eastern European heritage. We treasure our accomplishments, winning multiple awards for our meats. Bresaola received a Silver Sofi Award in 2021. Uncured Wagyu Harissa was a finalist for the Good Food Award in 2022. Wagyu Beef Salami won the 2024 Grand Honors Sofi.",

Paying homage to their own family experience, the food brand is a love letter to the siblings’ baba, or father, who immigrated to the U.S. from Jerusalem and opened one of Minnesota’s first Middle Eastern restaurants. The sibling duo launched Baba’s brand to bring the traditional Arab flavors they grew up eating, but with a contemporary twist, to grocery store shelves. Following the acclaim of their OG, oil-free hummus, Creamy Dreamy Traditional, they’ve since released fun modern flavors such as Sriracha, truffle, dill and za’atar — all found in major retailers like Whole Foods, Fresh Thyme, Costco and Hy-Vee. In June 2025, they will be launching with Target.",

There are no farms or orchards- all baobab fruit is wild harvested. We work with a network of harvesting cooperatives in rural communities to harvest the fruit, which in turns provides a perennial source of income for the harvesters, most of them women. A growing global market for baobab would transformative; with the potential to provide a source of income to 1 million people and $1 Billion a year to the continent. We are on a mission to share the wonders of baobab with the world!    We're excited to share our newly launched Baobab Superfruit Bites, which come in 3 delicious flavors. These clean-label fruit snacks are perfect for all occasion; school lunch, on-the-go snack, or just around the house. We are also introducing our retail baobab fruit powder.",

This time-honored technique creates a uniquely rough, porous surface that effortlessly clings to every drop of sauce for more flavor in every bite.    Bronze cut pasta is a term used to describe the method of making pasta by extruding pasta dough through a bronze die or form to give it a specific shape. “Bronze cut” specifically refers to the bronze die that creates a course, porous surface on the pasta. Al Bronzo pasta is made with innovative, micro-engraved bronze dies that give Al Bronzo pasta a rough and textured pasta surface. The result?

Our growing community of “besties” can’t get enough of the vibrant, fresh taste that supports their dietary needs and wellness goals. Whether you're nut-allergic, gluten-intolerant, avoiding seed oils, or just a pesto lover craving bold flavor—Besto delivers. What sets us apart? A generous 9 oz jar and wholesome ingredients like spinach and apple cider vinegar. It’s more than a condiment—it’s a daily dose of green goodness that tastes amazing on everything: toss it with pasta, drizzle on eggs or steak, or spread it on toast.

With dedication and love,  they cultivated the finest fruits, vegetables, and livestock, crafting timeless  recipes that still resonate today. From handcrafted pastas and sauces to  freshly baked breads and pastries to exquisite olive oils and balsamics,  their creations stood as a testament to tradition and quality.    In the early 1900s, Grandfather Carmine ventured to America, bringing  with him the heart and soul of Carlino’s cuisine. Joined by his daughter-  in-law, the beloved “Mama Carlino,” they opened the first Carlino’s  Market in Ardmore, Pa., in the 1980s. What began as a humble storefront  blossomed into a culinary haven, renowned for its homemade pastas, sauces and delectable fare.    Today, Carlino's is a culinary leader, offering handcrafted, locally sourced, and imported delicacies, celebrating tradition, family, and culinary craftsmanship.",

Celia bars are made from the finest organic cacao beans from Ecuador with floral and fruity notes, and our whole nuts are sourced from local farms in California.  Our chocolate bars are sweetened with coconut sugar that offers a lower glycemic index. Additionally, the bars offer a vegan, gluten free, and dairy-free experience without additives or preservatives.

A table full of friends that become family. Around the table would be seated artisans, farmers, and ranchers, people from the countryside with a million stories to tell, professionals in operations and exportation, but also cooks, designers and photographers making sure the table is always perfect… A great team of professionals, but above all of people, who comprise the great Don Gastronom family.    We travel to every corner of Spain, seeking out new members of our family, small producers with whom we create unique products, typical of our culture and prepared in traditional ways. And we remove any and all obstacles that may arise in order to take them as far as necessary.    Today we own more than 25 private brands, enjoyed in over 40 countries.",

That means bonafide butter and eggs, with zero junky or artificial ingredients to ruffle your feathers. And we do it in a way that’s deliciously sustainable—baking with upcycled oat flour and turning our food waste into renewable energy.    We do all of that so you can have your own feel good, fancy moment. Whether it’s at the end of a long day or even at the beginning of one, we’re here to make your day feel just a smidge more special.    A little oven. A lot of heart.  Maura graduated from Harvard with a master’s degree in Mind, Brain, and Education, but day after day she kept turning to baking to shake off the stress of working in statistical analysis. Inspired by the cookies she used to eat after school in her grandmother’s kitchen, Maura focused on real ingredients, homemade taste, and creating a delicious moment.",

With host Sean Evans, Hot Ones is a digital juggernaut with over 3B lifetime views, 15M subscribers, and an insane social media following of 27M.     In late 2022, we took a bold step - testing Hot Sauce in retail.  Results spoke for themselves and 2023 was all about building strategy.  In 2024 we launched nationwide, securing over 33K points of distribution and selling over 1M bottles! Our Hot Ones hot sauce items ranked high - out of 68 new items launched, all of our Hot Ones items ranked in the top 12 for $/TDP.    Growth is the testament to the power of the Hot Ones brand.  While launching Hot Sauce may have warmed us up to the potential in retail, we have been designing innovation that will continue to fuel the fire for years to come!",

What started as a hobby during the pandemic quickly evolved into a full-fledged business. After sharing their homemade sauces with friends and family, the Dziekans saw a growing demand for bold, flavor-forward condiments made without shortcuts.

Our chickens are raised in partnership with family farmers in Pennsylvania. Our love of animals has guided us over our 30+ year history to provide the best possible care for our animals. Every animal is individually evaluated by a USDA Inspector under strict guidelines for wholesomeness. Hudson Valley Farms is committed to fostering the connection between farm, chef, and consumer. We celebrate the burgeoning interest in meeting the farmers that raise our food. We are proud farmers who take great pride in what we do, and the quality of care that we deliver to our animals and products. Please call us to arrange a visit. Media are welcome as well.

Indian River Select supports its commitment to excellence by only using carefully selected fruits to create better-tasting, premium quality juices that can be found in most major retail grocery stores. In addition to crafting delicious and nutrient-rich beverages, Indian River Select places a high value on the growth and support of the local community. They are passionate about giving back and investing in their community by supporting various initiatives and causes.  We use fruit that has been carefully chosen from various growing regions. This fruit is then gently squeezed and processed in small runs, to a higher standard, thus giving our juice a richer, sweeter taste.  Today our juice can be found in about 3,500 fine grocery stores throughout the United States, but still remains one of Florida’s best-kept secrets.",

During her work, she saw firsthand how pecan production motivates farmers to prioritize water conservation. Pecans are more than a delicious nut—they’re a cornerstone of native plant ecosystems, water sustainability, and regenerative agriculture.    But there was a challenge: while premium half-shell pecans command high prices, smaller pecan pieces often went unsold, leaving farmers without a reliable market for them.    That’s where PKN® comes in. Laura founded Lifestock and partnered with leading pecan growers to develop a creamy, nutritious pecan milk that upcycles even the smallest pecan pieces. The result? A rich, dairy-free milk that delivers on taste while supporting American farmers, reducing waste, and championing regenerative farming practices.    With every glass of PKN, you’re helping create a sustainable future—one sip at a time.",

Born from a desire to elevate the non-alcoholic experience, Luba crafts bold, zero-proof cocktails using only natural, clean ingredients you can recognize. No mind-altering additives, no artificial dyes—just real flavor that speaks for itself. Every can is a celebration of living fully and intentionally, inspired by the vibrant legacy of Christiana’s grandmother, Luba. When founders Christiana and Nic saw a gap in the market—where non-alcoholic options tasted like watered-down afterthoughts—they set out to do better. Their vision? Premium, ready-to-drink cocktails that taste amazing and feel like a treat, not a compromise. With a blend of cane sugar and monk fruit for balance, Luba Libations brings a naturally sweet, crisp experience people can’t stop talking about. One sip and the response is always the same: “This actually tastes amazing!”",

With our perfect chewy-meets-crispy texture, we knew we had something special. As a locally owned and operated business, we proudly collaborate with local farmers and communities, celebrating the rich bounty of Maine.

Our crackers and crisps are more than just snacks; they're a celebration of health, sustainability, and community.

Featured in the New York Times, Sushi Bakes offer a convenient twist: deconstructed sushi rolls in a casserole.  Mama Hu created them so her sushi-loving teens could enjoy sushi-style meals with just 30 minutes in the oven or 5 minutes in the microwave. Inspired by classic recipes, we use top-quality ingredients moms trust—wild Alaska seafood, organic avocado, and organic tofu. All our bakes are gluten-free, with vegan options too. Current flavors include Spicy Salmon, California Roll, Teriyaki Tofu & Broccoli, and Veggie Roll.  Beloved by busy millennial families and young professionals, Mama Hu’s Sushi Bakes won 1st Prize and Audience Choice at The Big Connecticut Food Event at Yale in March 2025, one of CT’s top food entrepreneur pitch competitions.",

Jamón cured in the pure air of the Sierra de Francia, the perfect microclimate  which allows for a much slower curing process than in any other place, giving our products  a Flavor, Aroma and Texture which are truly exceptional.

We grew up fascinated by the local cuisine, especially Spanish charcuterie. In Spain, charcuterie is considered a national treasure but also something to eat everyday—on its own or as a cooking ingredient—as we did.    Nearly 20 years ago, we moved to the U.S., where high-quality Spanish charcuterie is hard to find. We miss the flavors of these wonderful meats, but even more we miss sitting with friends over plates of jamon and glasses of vermouth and just talking, laughing, and slowing down. That’s the Spanish way, and that’s what we’re sharing with you.",

We believe great products start with great ingredients—so we go straight to the source. We make our chocolate from scratch, starting with whole cacao beans, and roast our coffee with the same hands-on care. This farm-to-factory model ensures radical transparency and unmatched quality.    Most importantly, we’re committed to changing how farmers are paid. In a world where many cacao and coffee producers remain trapped in poverty, we’re building a better system—one rooted in dignity, sustainability, and shared success.",

In a move that embodies Dr. Cheryl’s tenacity, and with her three young sons encouraging her, she started selling her homemade pimento cheese spread as a mother/son project after recovering. When her delicious and award-winning pimento cheese quickly sold out at a local market, she realized she had stumbled upon a new career.    Fifteen years later and using the highest standard of food safety (cold pasteurization), Dr. Cheryl continues to provide the highest quality, cleanest ingredient pimento cheese spread to households across the US.     Most importantly, because family is what she values most, her three sons continue to inspire her as she keeps shredding. At MTS, a woman owned and family-run business, we believe food should taste              Just Like Mom’s….. Maybe Even Better!",

The company offers a growing line of snack packs, antipasto, pre-sliced trays, individual sticks and bulk, charcuterie-worthy salami chubs to preferred retailers, discriminating foodies, natural snack lovers and those simply wanting an authentic taste of Italy.    From state-of-the-art processing facilities in Oceanside, Calif., which Oliviero and his team selected for its Mediterranean climate, Olli combines genuine Italian recipes, curing techniques and quality with a commitment to being the first 100% preservative free Italian salami producer in America",

It was created in 2009 when two experienced farm cooperatives, merged to create a powerful, modern oil mill. The name “Picualia” was chosen because the Picual olive is the members’ main crop. Of all the 2,600 types of olives found the world over, the Picual cultivar has the greatest number of healthy, antioxidant effects.  And so was born one of the most-innovative, best-known firms in the industry, making and marketing oils using only olives grown by Picualia’s member farmers. In 2016 Picualia was named the Best Oil Mill in Spain by the AEMO(Asociación Española de Municipios del Olivo).  Picualia’s reliability and deep commitment to making one of the finest extra-virgin olive oils in the world speak for themselves. Winners of over 50 Spanish and international prizes,  Picualia olive oils are ranked among the very best year after year.",

Our popcorn is certified gluten-free by GFCO, whole grain & high in fiber. Sustainability is important in everything we do- we buy our corrugated locally where it is made from 100% recycled content, we offer a \"buy back to recycle/upcycle\" popcorn bag program through Terracycle that builds brand loyalty and provides a sustainable solution, and we donate large buckets of broken & un-popped kernels each day to local animal rescue farms.",

The company's first customer was Cowgirl Creamery, where a collaboration with owners Sue Conley and Peggy Smith highlighted the need for artisan crackers to accompany their beautiful artisan cheeses. The Cowgirls bit into a sample of Rustic Bakery sourdough flatbread and immediately placed an order for 50 cases.     The first flatbread crackers were produced in a commercial bakery space behind a wine bar which was quickly taken over and turned into a cafe serving coffee, baked goods, quiche and salads accompanied with flatbread crackers.      We have since expanded to five Rustic Bakery cafes in Marin County situated between two world-class food destinations, San Francisco and the Napa Valley.  This year marks the 20th anniversary of that first shipment of Flatbread Crackers to Cowgirl Creamery.",

Born from the longing for salsa macha and the absence of bold, chile-forward flavors in Portland, we started making our own during a drawn-out immigration process—first to meet a personal need, then to build something rooted in our values.    Our salsas draw from Mexican tradition but embrace neo-Mexicanism—a reimagining of heritage through the lens of diaspora, creativity, and change. Made with integrity and simplicity, each jar features real ingredients like dried chiles, nuts, olive oil, and sea salt. No preservatives. No shortcuts. Just flavor that’s honest, layered, and alive.    We are proudly imagining Salsas del Barrio as a worker-owned business, committed to a democratic workplace and equitable growth. For us, flavor isn’t just about food—it’s about how we work, who we uplift, and the future we’re building.",

Eight generations have passed along the method of brewing high-quality Tamari from the finest soybeans. It starts with our Tamari. Unlike typical soy sauce, which contains about 40-60% wheat, Tamari is a type of soy sauce that is made with 100% soybeans and no wheat. This means more soy protein is contained in the finished product, resulting in a milder taste and higher complexity of flavors in the sauce. It is said that Tamari is the origin of Japanese soy sauce, and our brewing methods continue to provide authentic food experiences in today’s kitchens.  We make our Tamari with no artificial preservatives, flavors or color added, and it is non-GMO verified by the Non-GMO Project.",

We are proud to continue his legacy by sharing unique, flavorful, and affordable sauces. From an original line up of ten, we narrowed our product line down to three epic sauces: Aardvark Habanero Hot Sauce, Drunken Garlic Black Bean, and Drunken Jerk Jamaican Marinade. In 2018 we added Serrabanero Green Hot Sauce. In 2021, three new sauces were added to the Aardvark line up- Red Scorpion Fiery Hot Sauce, Smoky Aardvark Chipotle-Hab Sauce, and Aardvark Reaper Smoked Hot Sauce. You can also find us on Amazon US and Canada as well as sold thru our online store. We are exporting to Canada, Australia, the EU, UK, and New Zealand.

We keep our ice cream simple focusing on clean ingredients and fresh taste.      We produce our ice cream in pints, 4 oz single serves (spoon included) and the Sis'wich (the Sisters' ice cream sandwich).  Pints come in 14 flavors, 4 oz single serves in 8 ice cream flavors and 2 vegan fruit sorbets, and Sis'wiches in 5 flavors.",

Could it really be that healthy and delicious in a packaged snack is a mirage, an impossibility? Foolhardy enough to attempt the impossible, we at SoKusa believe that we succeeded where others failed. Must we, the health-conscious consumers, be stuck with the same old flavors of the same old ingredients? Countless recipes, tireless tastings, and innumerable trials with unique and different vegetables and fruit gave birth to SoKusa snacks: best raw ingredients handled with the most delicate, minimal touch. We are confident that you would agree at your first taste that SoKusa delivers a combination of nutrition and deliciousness in a handy snack.",

It all started in 2010, in our founder Bill’s kitchen. Bill wanted to create a beverage he could feel good about serving to his whole family. First, he made real fruit sodas and then, after lots of trial and error, the very first sparkling water in America made with real squeezed fruit.    Spindrift debuted in artisan Boston-area shops and eateries where it caught the eye of local foodies and craft beverage fans. Then, it grew from a cult-like following to a wide, diverse fan base. Today it’s available throughout the US in national retailers, grocery stores, and restaurants alike.    The Spindrift team is obsessively involved with the entire process in the creation of our sparkling waters. From visiting the farms where we source the best-tasting ingredients, to being on-site for every single production run, to tasting each and every batch.",

Growing peppers we source from our travels, we are a 50% female-owned company set on strengthening food chains and building a more responsible future of food. Our products are all-natural, sugar-free, and packaged in environmentally friendly materials.  In 2024, we earned both Scovie and Flave Awards for 3 of our sauces. We were also featured in Real Simple, Condé Nast Traveler, and Ruth Reichl’s La Briffe. Today, our products are available in nearly 100 retailers, with distribution via Foundation Foods in Southern California.

Driven by Eileen’s rich experiences growing up on an Iowa farm and navigating the corporate world, Eileen found solace and purpose in the kitchen. That passion led Eileen to over 600 state and national baking awards. Sunday Night crafts its luxurious, shelf-stable, premium chocolate sauce in small batches with only the finest pure ingredients, winning three sofi awards its first three years: sofi Gold in 2024 and sofi New Product Awards in 2022 and 2023. Their Vegan Chocolate sauce was also a NEXTY Finalist in 2024. Consumers want better-quality, gourmet convenience food, and Sunday Night sauces satisfy that need with a new, disruptive product in an old category. The extraordinary silkiness and gloss in its sauces are achieved by using a classic French technique, creating pure, chocolate sauce without corn syrup, preservatives, palm oil, or emulsifiers.",

Founded by three friends with over a decade of experience living abroad in the US and Europe, our journey began with a shared passion for authentic Thai home-cook food. We longed for the taste of home and struggled to find ingredients that truly captured the essence of Thai flavors— existing brands were either too generic, fresh ingredients too complicated to source, and sauces available in impractical quantities.    Our personal quest to bring authentic Thai cooking home sparked the creation of TAAN THAI products: easy-to-cook meal kits that deliver genuine, home-cooked flavors without the hassle. Now, everyone can enjoy REAL EASY Thai food at home!",

This begins with our relationship with farming partners worldwide, to whom we pay a TCHO Quality Premium when they meet our high standards. And when we realized most cacao farmers have never tasted chocolate made from their beans, we built ten TCHO Flavor Labs around the world where we work alongside local farmers and agronomists to improve every aspect of cacao farming -- because better beans make better chocolate. As a certified B Corporation, we lean on our founding values of curiosity and connection to find new ways to use our business to better the world through chocolate.    That's why TCHO is Chocolate.

We don’t just bottle sauces—we bottle moments of alchemy. Moments when the right blend of spice, sweetness, and acidity turns a dish into something unforgettable. As we prepare to debut at the NYC Fancy Food Show, we’re proud to present Alchemy of Food to the world: a brand built for tastemakers, chefs, and flavor-seekers who know that food is more than fuel—it’s an experience.",

After settling down in Houston, she realized something was missing. She longed for the high-quality gourmet food products and kitchen accessories she was surrounded by back home. She realized that if she wanted the jams, mustards, oils, and cutlery that she missed, she would have to bring them to Houston herself. So, what started as a hobby, bringing in gourmet products for herself and her friends, turned into a business and The French Farm was born.    The French Farm has searched all over Europe to bring you and your family the finest imported gourmet foods and kitchen accessories. Our products are carefully crafted by small, family-owned businesses and are made using traditional recipes and techniques, which are handed down from one generation to the next.",

It all began almost 50 years ago when Wizzie, our beloved matriarch, stumbled upon some fresh mint growing wild by a spring on our farm in Chester County, Pennsylvania. With a stroke of inspiration and just four simple ingredients, she brewed the first batch of what would quickly become our treasured family recipe: Wizzie’s Lemon Mint Tea. Over the years, we’ve shared this unique blend with friends and neighbors alike. As our story grows, we developed four additional irresistible flavors to join our family of teas - Peach Ginger, Blueberry Hibiscus, Passion Fruit Lime, and Lemon Mint Green Tea! Enjoy all five of our teas and find out why Wizzie’s is truly Tea to Talk About!™",

Next thing you know, bacon, deli meats and salamis were being delivered in Zoe’s Meats refrigerated vans and getting branded on menus. Fast forward 18 years and now there is equal focus on building the same relationships with chefs at home. The Zoe’s Meats motto has always been one customer at a time, one box at a time – and that hasn’t changed. With acquisition (Daphne’s Creamery) and incubation of a micro-brand (Two Chicks Jerky), Zoe’s Meats introduces gavro provisions to the family in our 18th year.",

With host Sean Evans, Hot Ones is a digital juggernaut with over 3B lifetime views, 15M subscribers, and an insane social media following of 27M.     In late 2022, we took a bold step - testing Hot Sauce in retail.  Results spoke for themselves and 2023 was all about building strategy.  In 2024 we launched nationwide, securing over 33K points of distribution and selling over 1M bottles! Our Hot Ones hot sauce items ranked high - out of 68 new items launched, all of our Hot Ones items ranked in the top 12 for $/TDP.    Growth is the testament to the power of the Hot Ones brand.  While launching Hot Sauce may have warmed us up to the potential in retail, we have been designing innovation that will continue to fuel the fire for years to come!",
